This project is a barebone market application where people can create accounts, 
create and update their listings, delete listings and view all listings on the market.
Users are not required to login to view the market but they need to register and log in
to create a new listing, update listing and delete listings of their own.
When a user creates a new listing, an email will be sent to the user's email that he used
for registration. Because of the constraint of mailgun, I can only send emails to verified
email address for this demo. A screen shot of confirmation email is included in this directory
as "listing_creation_email.jpg".
This is achieved through cloud function. The detail of the implementation can be found
in the cloud function dashboard of my project.
On the topic of email, I have implemented a health check cron task that checks for the
health condition of the market endpoints every 6 hours.
